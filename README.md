# covid19_ml

## The data is downloaded from kaggle bluebook for COVID19 Global Forecasting,
## https://www.kaggle.com/c/covid19-global-forecasting-week-4/data

## I have downloaded two datasets:
*	train.csv - the training data
*	test.csv - the dates to predict

## This analysis is performed on limited data. But if good amount of data is available, there is scope to come up with better results.
